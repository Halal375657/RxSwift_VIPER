     If observable sequence has produced at least one element, after new subscription is made last produced element will be
     immediately replayed on the same thread on which the subscription was made.

     If `drive*`, `subscribe*` and `bind*` are called from background thread, it is possible that initial replay
     will happen on background thread, and subsequent events will arrive on main thread.
